"""run_layer1.py — Layer 1: listens for every live Layer 0 node's
(r_i, psi_i) reports on the wire layer0_report.py already defines
(239.0.0.6:7460), computes the instantaneous mean-field (r1, psi1) from
whichever psi_i values are currently live, then RK4-integrates
Layer1Node's own carrier toward psi1 instead of just snapshotting it and
stopping (see layer1_oscillator.py's docstring for why this is a real
gap being filled, not a rewrite of something that already worked).

Layer 1's own report goes back out on the same wire as node_id 'layer1'
-- the recursive structure layer0_report.py's docstring describes
("whatever subscribes to a Layer 0 report can subscribe to Layer 1's the
same way") continuing one level up. What gets broadcast as Layer 1's
(r, psi): r1 (the real, honestly-computed upstream coherence -- Layer 1
is a single oscillator, so a literal order-parameter over itself would
be a fabricated constant 1.0, not a fixed reference-frame stub) and
theta (Layer 1's own integrated carrier phase, the thing this module
actually adds).
