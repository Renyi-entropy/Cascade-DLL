"""regime_classifier.py — separate consumer of the substrate's real
broadcast, same shape as gpu_layer0/reflex_power_cap.py: listens to
Layer 1's (r1, psi1, dt_lag1) reports on the real wire
(layer0_report.py, 239.0.0.6:7460), makes its own decision, never feeds
anything back into the substrate itself.

Classifies CALM vs TURBULENT from a 30s EMA of r1 -- Layer 1 is the
level this session actually validated for slow-regime characterization
(rock-solid on multi-minute drift, proven blind to sub-minute events via
the load_probe CPU-spike test). A single instantaneous r1 reading isn't
trustworthy on its own (see the t=62.5s false spike in tracking_err1
during that same test) -- the 30s EMA filters that out while staying far
more responsive than goal_field.py's 120s-time-constant S, which lags
too much to flag a live regime shift promptly.

Hysteresis, not a single threshold: enters CALM only above
CALM_ENTER_R, exits CALM (back to TURBULENT) only below CALM_EXIT_R.
Without the gap between those two thresholds, a reading sitting near one
fixed cutoff flaps on ordinary noise -- the same multi-timescale-
hysteresis pattern already load-bearing elsewhere in this codebase.

Pure classification + logging. No actuation of any kind -- if a real
action needs to be taken on a regime change, that's a separate,
explicit, later decision by a different consumer, not this one.
