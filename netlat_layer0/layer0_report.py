"""layer0_report.py — wire format for a Layer 0 node reporting its
order parameter (r, psi) up to a Layer 1 aggregator.

Multicast, same convention as the rest of the substrate (AxisPulse on
239.0.0.2:7404, RefleState on 239.0.0.4:7450, etc.) -- next unused
group/port pair: 239.0.0.6:7460.

This is deliberately NOT itself a phase-integrated oscillator layer --
Layer 1 just takes an instantaneous mean-field snapshot of whatever
psi values arrive (r1 = |mean(e^(i*psi_i))|), it doesn't RK4-integrate
its own carrier. Honest about that: this is the recursive mean-field
idea demonstrated in its simplest working form, not a second full
Layer0Node-style oscillator stacked on top. Build that properly later
if the simple version isn't enough, don't pretend it's already there.
[Update: layer1/run_layer1.py is that build -- listens on this same wire,
RK4-integrates its own carrier toward the mean-field psi instead of just
snapshotting it. fractal_layer1/layer1_aggregator.py is still the
snapshot-only version; both are legitimate, different jobs.]

dt_lag_s is the sender's own phase-tracking error converted to seconds
(tracking_err / omega -- how far in time this node's carrier currently
lags(+)/leads(-) whatever target it's forced toward). Only meaningful for
a sender that's actually forced toward a single tracked target (Layer 1,
or any future single-oscillator forced layer) -- a Layer 0 node's r/psi
is a mean field over N of its own oscillators, not one phase with one
well-defined tracking error, so Layer 0 senders leave this NaN (see
send_report's default) rather than reporting a fabricated number.
Receivers that don't care can ignore it same as they'd ignore any other
field; receivers that do care must check math.isnan() before using it.
